            <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-2"> After we had switched to full distance learning in around November, I struggled a lot. It was hard for me to do the homework for a class I met online with only twice a week. I did not hold myself accountable for doing the homework or completing the projects. It would take me a couple weeks after a project was due to finally start it. It wasn’t because I thought the projects were too hard, usually I’d be able to complete them within a couple hours or less, I just was not motivated because school seemed more like a hobby at the time since we only met twice a week. Once I had put one project off, it was easy for me to continue that cycle. I was finally able to push myself out of it when the second trimester was ending and I had an actual set due date that I had to finish them by. I finally completed a project on time and then I was able to get back on track. I still procrastinate, but I don’t put off my homework for weeks at a time. It taught me that I need to actually hold myself accountable and create set deadlines for my tasks, along with a set time to complete them, or I’ll keep putting them off. Finding this out about myself before I head off to college was definitely a very beneficial step in finding out more about myself, and it will hopefully save my grades for college next year.
