  <p1>This project took a lot of tweaking. The hardest part was getting the particles to bounce off the edges. To figure out how to do this, I watched a video of Dr. R explaining how his code worked. I then tweaked his code to make it work for my particle. This project was very interesting to make because it was the first time I used cosine and sine in my code. It was really cool to see how that made the particle move.</p1>
